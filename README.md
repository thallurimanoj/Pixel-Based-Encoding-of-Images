# Pixel-Based-Encoding-of-Images
This project implements a simple yet secure image encryption and decryption system using pixel-based encoding. The encryption algorithm applies an XOR operation to image pixels using two secret keys â€” one for rows and one for columns. This ensures lossless encryption and prevents unauthorized access to the original image data.
